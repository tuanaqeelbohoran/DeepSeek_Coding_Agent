# DeepSeek_Coding_Agent
This project gives you an autonomous agent that:  - Uses a DeepSeek model through **Unsloth** for planning + tool use. - Optionally runs **DeepSeek-OCR-2** first (following Unsloth docs) to extract context from screenshots. - Can read/write files and run shell commands inside a workspace loop.
